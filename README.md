# Personal-Task-Tracker
This is CS 5004 Final Project

Through this project, you can create a new task, view the task,
and edit the task.

Strictly adhere to Big Ideas of OOD:
encapsulation, inheritance, composition, polymorphism, abstraction, MVC

Future extensions:
1. use .json/ MySQL
2. try Spring Boot
3. generate summary of tasks regularly through AI
